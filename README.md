# QUANT-UDL-Scenarios
Scenarios for the QUANT and UDL Projects.

Here we store our inputfiles for some different scenarios we want to try. 


Things to do: 
Maarten 
- Create a read me file for the impact statistics
- Create a code to do some easy analysis of scenarios

Richard 
- Find a way to share the baseline cost matrices and the adapted cost matrices.
